# Shelf

This is my personal "yet-another-book-shelf" project.
The intent was to make a simple terminal program to keep track of my physical
library.

It is written in C and uses SQLite and STFL libraries (links below).
These have to be installed in prior so the compilation succeeds.
Please change their paths in Makefile if they are different on your system.
