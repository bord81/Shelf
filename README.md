# Shelf

This is my personal "yet-another-book-shelf" project.
The intent was to make a simple terminal program to keep track of my physical
library.

It is written in C and uses SQLite, STFL and ncursesw libraries (links to the first two below).
These have to be installed in prior so the compilation succeeds.
Please change their paths in Makefile if they are different on your system.
And then simply run 'make'.

P.S.: As of now working with non-ASCII symbols is not supported but I'm going to fix it soon.
